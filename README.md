Coding in Java and using Android Studio to develop various apps was initially a difficult experience, but as time progressed, it became a more manageable and enjoyable process. The project involved creating the Simple Inventory App, designed to help Android users effortlessly manage their home or business inventory tasks. The primary goal was to address the user's need for a user-friendly, streamlined, and efficient inventory management solution. 

The app's design had to cater to various user needs, such as adding and categorizing inventory items, setting low inventory alerts, and providing SMS notifications for important inventory updates. To meet these needs, I designed screens and features that allowed users to easily add, edit, and view their inventory items while ensuring data was organized and readily accessible. 

User-centered UI design was at the forefront of my approach. I aimed to keep the interface simple, intuitive, and visually pleasing. Icons and buttons were chosen for clarity and ease of use. I minimized clutter and focused on providing clear feedback to guide users throughout the app. 

My approach to coding was systematic and structured, although quite slow. I followed best practices for Android app development, using structured code architecture to maintain a clean and modular codebase. I incorporated version control to manage code changes effectively. These techniques are invaluable for future projects as they ensure code maintainability and scalability. 

Testing was an integral part of the development process. I performed JUnit tests, UI tests, and functionality tests to ensure the code was robust and free of critical errors. This process is crucial because it helps identify and rectify issues early in the development cycle, resulting in a more reliable app. 

During the app's development journey, I was required to overcome challenges related to database management and SMS notification integration. I had to devise creative solutions to ensure efficient data handling and reliable notifications while maintaining data privacy and security. 

One component that highlighted knowledge was the SMS notification feature. I successfully implemented a system that sends SMS alerts to users when their inventory is running low. This component involved integrating SMS services and handling user permissions, requiring an understanding of Android development and API integrations.
